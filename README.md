# RayCaster
Ray caster game

This is ray caster game where you are ment to shoot the yello boxes to get a high score.
It is all contained within a single python file hence why there are no textures on the objects.
I assume you have a python interpretor if you dont have pygame installed then pip install pygame.
Nothing else is required for it to run.
